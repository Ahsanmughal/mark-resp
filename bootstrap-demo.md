### Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines]() and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue]().

Note that **feature requests must target** [Bootstrap v4](), because Bootstrap v3 is now in maintenance mode and is closed off to new features. This is so that we can focus our efforts on Bootstrap v4.
